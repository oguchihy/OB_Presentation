<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>OB service at CSVS is delivered by dedicated clinicians and staff who provide tools- and procedure-validated comprehensive natal education through the CPSP program; prenatal care, hospital and delivery care, as well as post-natal care. OB deliveries are currently performed only at NMC which keeps a standard meticulous record of the delivery event and related issues. Each phase of OB care –prenatal, peripartal and postpartal– presents opportunities and challenges depending on the effects of relevant factors which impact care, especially the central event of OB care, Delivery.</p>
<p>The goal of this document is to explore the data and present analytical results for information, education and action where indicated.</p>

<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Overview</h1>
<p>Between 2021-12-30 and 2024-03-30, a period of <strong>9 quarters</strong> or <strong>27 months</strong>, <strong><em>1720</em></strong> CSVS prenatal patients delivered at NMC, which is the principal source of data for this analysis.This included <strong>853 females</strong>, <strong>845 males</strong> and <strong>22 unknowns</strong> (49.6, 49.1, 1.3 % respectively). There were <strong>14 multiple gestations</strong> –all twins – a 0.8% incidence. There was <strong>1 Fetal Demise</strong> during the period.</p>
<p>Primary <strong>Cesarean section</strong> rate was <strong><code>12.2</code>%</strong>, constituting <strong>51.4%</strong> of all c-sections. Repeat C-Section rate was <strong><code>11</code>%</strong>. Total C-section rate was <strong><code>23.7</code>%</strong>.</p>
<p>The average <strong>monthly</strong> delivery for CSVS for the period was <strong>64</strong>. <strong>Each day</strong>, on the average, <strong>2 deliveries</strong> occurred.</p>
<p>Average <strong>birth weight</strong> was <strong>3300gm</strong>, with minimum <strong>180gm</strong> and maximum of <strong>5030gm</strong>. <strong>Maternal age</strong> range was between <strong><em>13</em></strong> and <strong><em>44</em></strong>, with a <strong><em>median age of 27</em></strong>.

<p>From the figures above, we learn that there</p>
<ul>
<li>relatively fewer pregnancies in ages, 19 and under (<strong><code>10</code>%</strong>) than over 35 (<strong><code>13</code>%</strong>)</li>
<li>primips account for <strong><code>26</code>%</strong>; second pregnancies <strong><code>26</code>%</strong>; so slightly over half of all our deliveries are to women with 1 or 2 deliveries, counting the current pregnancy as a delivery</li>
<li>most deliveries score APGAR-1 <strong>8 and over</strong>; and APGAR-5 <strong>9</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does the Zip code make any difference with respect to gravidarity or parity?</p>

<p>Yes, there is a difference in the distribution, but only for Parity (number of deliveries) – for both 93905 (higher in lower parity levels) and 93927 (higher in higher parity levels), with a significant p-value of 0.043. There was no difference with respect to Gravidarity (number of pregnancies)</p>
<p>Is there a difference in the distribution of different age-groups among and within zip codes? As before, first, check the p-value. It is 0.105, so the answer is, No.</p>

<p>Yes, there is a significant difference (p = &lt;0.001 for both) in the distribution of <em>Gravidarity</em> and of <em>Parity</em> within and among zip codes.</p>
<p>The distribution patterns suggest a trend where younger women (&lt;21) predominantly have their first child, and as age increases, women are more likely to have higher parity deliveries. The 29-35 and &gt;35 age groups, in particular, show a significant percentage of deliveries at higher parity levels, indicating that some women are indeed delaying childbirth to later ages.</p>
<p>We turn our attention next to non-completed or undelivered pregnancies or pregnancies without delivery, the count-difference between gravidarity and parity.This may reflect the state of family planning.</p>

<p>For our patient population, annually, an average of <strong><code>15</code>%</strong> of pregnancies were not delivered. There is a statistically significant association between age group and pregnancy outcome (p = <code>0.0012</code>). This suggests that the likelihood of pregnancies resulting in delivery or not, differs significantly across the different age groups. When considering the annual incidence rate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Age group 21-29 has the highest annual incidence rate of pregnancies without delivery (17 per year).</p></li>
<li><p>Age group &lt;21 has the lowest annual incidence rate (13 per year).</p></li>
<li><p>Age groups 29-35 and &gt;35 have similar annual incidence rates (15 per year).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These findings suggest that women in the 21-29 age group experience the highest rate of pregnancies without delivery, while the youngest group (&lt;21) has the lowest rate. The older age groups (29-35 and &gt;35) have intermediate rates. This could imply that younger women (&lt;21) and older women (&gt;35) have different risk factors or behaviors affecting pregnancy outcomes compared to women in their late 20s.</p>
<p><em>Of note: <strong>for all “gravida-parity”</strong>, there is no significant variation by zip code.</em> (p_value = <code>0.9999953</code>)</p>
<p>Overall, the significant association and the annual incidence rates highlight important age-related differences in pregnancy outcomes, which could be crucial for targeted interventions and healthcare planning.</p>
<p>Numbers were derived by adding the gravidarity and subtracting parity, while crediting one imminent delivery to P0; and accounting for multiple gestation.</p>
<p><strong>For only the first-ever delivery alone (Para 0)</strong>, here is the outcome:</p>

<p>Focusing on first deliveries only, for every 4 delivered pregnancies, one pregnancy was not delivered, given an overall not-delivered incidence rate of <strong><code>21</code>%</strong>. At the time of the first deliveries <strong>only</strong>, there is a significant variance by zip code:</p>
<ul>
<li>93905 has highest delivery gaps in age-group &lt;21, least in &gt;35; even in the rest of the groups</li>
<li>93906 has least gap in &lt;21 and &gt;35; rest are even</li>
<li>93927 has the highest gap in &gt;35 followed by &lt;21; rest are even</li>
<li>93930 has the least gap in 21-29 and &lt;21, highest gap in 29-35, followed by &gt;35</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, regarding pregnancies without delivery disparity <em>at the time of the first delivery</em>, the data may show a pattern (See plot above) of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>high disparity at younger ages and low disparity for older ages in 93905;</p></li>
<li><p>high disparity for the middle age groups and low disparity for the younger and the older ages in 93906;</p></li>
<li><p>high disparity for the younger and the older age groups and low disparity for the middle age groups for 93927;</p></li>
<li><p>high disparity for the older age groups and low disparity for the younger age groups for 93930</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Our records were collected on a continuum of time, so let’s take a look. The time series plot is based on weekly deliveries: One can guesstimate the average weekly delivery and well as get a hint as to the trending of weekly deliveries.</p>

<p>Exploratory Data analyses yields rich information. However, we need to proceed with analytics so we can query the data in order to get desired information. We need to know how variables of interest affect one another, and how they compare with one another in their contribution to the results or outcome of interest to us. The outcome of interest to us in OB can be found in prenatal care (before delivery), during delivery; the event of delivery itself and right after delivery.</p>
<p>A pre-delivery outcome, for example, is pre-term (prematurity) status; another is High Risk OB status. During delivery, we are concerned about outcomes categorized by “intrapartal conditions” such as preeclampsia and also “intrapartal events” which encompass abnormal labor dynamics. We want to know: Did delivery occur at all? How long was the time from admission to delivery? What are the chances that at a given time delivery will have occurred, and what percent of patients will have delivered by a certain time? For each of these outcomes or combinations thereof, our interest is how and if variables like maternal age, zip code, parity, high risk status, affected the end-result.</p>
<p>We all are curious to know if and how residential geography affects OB outcomes. We will use zipcode information (the variable, “zip”) and a standard MAP to explore this curiosity. High Risk OB is a technical definition; we can explore what contributes to it, as well as determine how it affects other outcomes as mentioned above. A fundamental method in statistical data analytics is to “throw in” all the data, together, “stir it up” and see if the data will settle out in a natural separation into groups–called clustering–that achieves statistical significance. If we can find significant clusters, we can also use them, along with zip and high risk status as probes with which to analyze outcomes.</p>
<p>We applied cluster statistics on the data using fetal weight against gestational age: here is our finding:</p>

<h3 data-number="2.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cluster-analysis"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Cluster Analysis</h3>
<p>Right now, we are going to look into the important OB metrics of Gestational Age and Birth weight of our patients using Cluster Analysis<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, a useful method in medical research for identifying patterns among patients that help to characterize clinical states and associated risks and treatment outcomes without predefined categories.</p>
<p>Using k-means clustering algorithm with a choice of 3 clusters (arbitrary), we obtained these stats and plots:</p>

<p>The plot shows the separation of a left lower quad (LLQ) cluster from an un-separated 2 other clusters. Further analysis shows that the LLQ cluster is statistically significantly different from either of the 2 other clusters, while this is not the case between these 2 clusters themselves. By adding the 3000 GRAM birth weight dashed horizontal line and the 37 week dashed vertical line, representing the demarcations for SGA and Preterm respectively we find a correspondence between SGA and preterm delivery, a widely known outcome. The clusters were named after this finding, as: Pre-term; Term, early; and Term, full (latter two are from 37 weeks and over). CAVEAT: Actual preterm deliveries as defined by gestational age (alone) under 37 weeks account for only <strong>8%</strong> of the deliveries, compared to the cluster group here defined by both SGA AND Preterm (<strong>4.1%</strong>); both are relatively small numbers compared to the total number of deliveries.</p>

<p>The top 5 are 93905 (one-third of all deliveries), 93906 (one-fifth), 93927 (one-sixth); 95012 (one-twelfth), 93930 (one-twentieth). One thing stands out: considering its size and straddling location, 99308 is a sparse draw for CSVS deliveries.</p>

We will start by taking another look at the weekly deliveries, to check for patterns (seasonality) and overall direction of the total number of deliveries (trend); and then, predict number of deliveries as forecast for the next quarter.</p>
<p>Is there seasonality to the deliveries? Do we have a trend?</p>

<p>The top graph shows the same weekly deliveries time series seen earlier. The second and third panels tease out the series to extract seasonality information and trend, respectively. The last panel superimposes the seasonality and trend graphs on the original time series. We can see a trend that “trough-ed” around end of the first quarter of 2023 and is rising since then. The seasonality graph nearly matches the original data, indicating that there is a significant seasonal variation in weekly deliveries among our patients.</p>
<p>What might account for the trough? Below we compare the original (full data) trend with the trend of each of the components of various variables to look for patterns.</p>

<p>If the trend of the original data (“Overall Trend) parallels the variable’s trend visually, the latter must be contributing significantly to the shape and direction of the former. However, we must rely on p-values for statistical significance. Thus, the following contribute significantly to the trend that we observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>zip: 93930</li>
<li>hghRsk: no</li>
<li>age_group: 29-35</li>
</ul>
<p>but, not the rest of the zipcodes, cluster, age groups (including UDS age group)</p>
<p>An important and practical goal of data analysis is to make future forecasts. Based on the weekly delivery numbers for 117 weeks or nine quarters, we can predict the following quarter’s performance: check the plot, and then the table for comparison between actual and predicted data.

<p>How does zip code affect the distribution of outcomes like Preterm (derived from cluster analysis)and High Risk OB? We will throw in another interesting outcome, Delivery Method (vaginal versus Caeserian section)?</p>

<p>First, always check the p-values for the various distribution tables.</p>
<p>The answer is: there is no significant difference in the relative distribution, among and within different zip codes, of Pre-term deliveries (p=0.508), High Risk OB (p=0.792), Delivery Method (p=0.976).</p>
<p>What about the High Risk OB and the outcomes of Preterm &amp; Delivery Method?</p>

<p>With a p-value &lt;0.001, a statistically significant difference is obvious in the distribution of Cesarean sections compared to Vaginal deliveries among High Risk OB. The same holds true for Preterm distribution: a significantly higher percent are in High Risk group than non-Preterm (39.8% Vs 19.2%, p-value &lt;0.001).</p>

<!-- Next, we perform correlation analysis on our data -->
<!-- ### Correlation Analysis (Spearman method) -->
<!-- Correlation -->
<!-- :   Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where values close to 1 or -1 indicate strong positive or negative relationships, respectively, and values close to 0 indicate no relationship. -->
<!-- We have prepared an interactive table to facilitate the exercise. Keep in mind that the included p-value determines whether there is a statistical significance or not. ***There are 15x14 possible pair-combinations, so, think, "parsimony".*** -->

<p>The analysis shows that Preterm</p>
<ul>
<li><p>is significantly associated with different frequencies of different Labor types (p=0.009) AND different intrapartal conditions (p= &lt;0.001)</p></li>
<li><p>but NOT different intrapartal events (p=0.172)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, for this series of frequency and distribution analysis, we can conclude that High Risk OB has significant impact on Intrapartal events and Intrapartal conditions, as well as Labor Type.</p>
<p>There are many other ways to analyze the data with this method. For example, we can address questions like: <em>does labor induction lead to more C-sections?</em></p>

<p>We show a statistically significant effect (p = &lt;0.001): Induced labor is associated with a higher frequency of Primary C-Section when compared to other delivery types (36.4%), but also when Primary C-Section rate is compared to Vaginal Delivery rate for the labor induction group (36.4% Vs 25.1%). That solves out to <strong>Odds Ratio of 1.70</strong> (We will see Odds Ratio again later); meaning that the odds of having Primary C-Section are 1.7 times higher for labor induction group, and it is statistically significant at p-value &lt;0.001)</p>

<p>Yes, in fact, at a p-value = &lt;0.001, the percent distribution is: 44.5%, 32.8%, and 15.6% for C/S– Primary; C/S– Repeat; and Vaginal delivery respectively when High Risk OB is a present condition.</p>
<p>Moving on to a different analysis schema: Survival Analysis (SA) or by Time-to-Event (TTE) Analysis.</p>

<dt>Survival or Time-to_Event (TTE) Analysis</dt>
<dd>
<p>Survival analysis, or time-to-event analysis, is a statistical method used to analyze the expected duration until one or more events occur, such as death or failure. It involves the use of survival functions to estimate the probability of surviving past a certain time point. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function from observed survival times. Cumulative hazard (cumHaz) functions represent the accumulated risk of the event over time. Hazard ratios (HR) compare the hazard or event rates between two groups, indicating the relative likelihood of the event occurring in one group compared to another.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Survival Analysis can answer the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the probability of being undelivered at a given time after admission? (yields Median Survival)</p></li>
<li><p>What percent of all deliveries would have occurred at a given time after admission? (Cumulative Hazard)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the comparative likelihood of delivery having occurred given a certain condition versus absence of such a condition at a certain time (Hazard Ratio, (HR))?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are important questions for planning, predictions and for information for patient.</p>
<section id="definitions" class="level5" data-number="4.0.3.0.1">
<h5 data-number="4.0.3.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="definitions"><span class="header-section-number">4.0.3.0.1</span> Definitions</h5>
<p>Here’s a definition of terms relevant to Survival or Time-to_Event (TTE) Analysis :</p>
<p><strong>Event</strong>: <em>Delivery</em> or the outcome</p>
<p>There is an associated delivery date with time that defines the event occurrence</p>
<p><strong>Intervention</strong>: <em>Admission to the NMC</em></p>
<p>A date-time is associated with Intervention</p>
<p><strong>Interval</strong>: <em>Duration</em> of time between Intervention and Event.</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong>: any <em>slice</em> of, or <em>point</em> , in time (not Duration) within Interval</p>
<p><strong>Survival</strong>: <em>“Survived” Event</em> at any given Time</p>
<p><strong>Hazard</strong>: <em>Risk of Event at any point in time</em> at any given Time</p>
<p><strong>Cumulative Hazard</strong>: <em>Accumulated Risk of event up to a given point in time</em> at any given time</p>
<p><strong>Hazard Ratio (HR)</strong>: <em>Relative hazard rates between two groups at any given point in time</em> at any given Time</p>
<p>In our case, given that the Event is Delivery, <strong>Survival</strong> means “<em>survived</em> delivery”, ie., <strong>delivery has NOT occurred</strong> at the specified Time; or, a status of <strong>undelivered</strong>.</p>
<p>These definitions will facilitate the interpretation of our analyses when we use the popular analytic method called Survival Analysis (SA) or Time to Event (TTE) analysis.</p>
<p>For Survival or TTE Analysis, we will use the method of Cox Proportional Hazards; this permits the taking into account together of all the variables that contribute to an outcome (or event) even while focusing on a particular variable of interest. The data subset will exclude deliveries done before patient had a chance for admission-registration, the latter being the time-stamp to start the clock of Intervention. That leaves <strong><code>1598</code></strong> deliveries, a substantial <strong><code>93</code>%</strong> of all deliveries.</p>

<p>There’s the top plot (Survival Plot) which shows the probability of Survival at any time; and the bottom plot (Cumulative Hazard Plot) which shows accumulated events at any time. In the top / Survival Plot, the intersecting vertical and horizontal lines determine “median survival (time)”: the time at which survival probability is 50% (time at which half the population will have survived (or experienced) the event). Time, for our purposes, is measured in hours since hospital admission registration.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that for our data,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Survival” = not delivered (or undelivered);</p></li>
<li><p>“Event” = “Hazard” = Delivered.</p></li>
<li><p>“Risk” = the risk of Delivery.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can interpret the top graph as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>median survival is 12 hours; or,</p></li>
<li><p>the time when half of our patients is <strong>expected</strong> to be still undelivered is 12 hours; or,</p></li>
<li><p>Our patients have a 50% probability of being undelivered at 12 hours after admission.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the bottom graph, we determine the time when the cumulative deliveries show 50% still need to deliver (or are still to deliver). It works out to be about 12 hours. Note: it’s just a coincidence that the median survival time (the time when half of our patients is still undelivered, based on probability) is also 12 hours.</p>
<p>This method is most informative when used to compare of different variable subsets, for example:</p>

<p>The example above compares the condition of <strong>membrane-rupture</strong> with <strong>no membrane-rupture</strong>. First thing to check is the p-value. A p-value of 0.34 is &gt; 0.05, there is therefore no statistically significant difference among this condition-binary with respect to probability of survival (undelivered); or cumulative hazard (total delivered) at any time. Based on the graph, at 11 hours, the probability of being undelivered is 50% for either of them. At 12 hours (your pick of time; it could have been at 20, 30, or 36 hours) the cumulative hazard (accumulated deliveries) is 55% and 61% respectively, which do not meet the test of statistical significance for being different.</p>
<p>On the other hand, below, when comparing the intrapartal condition, <strong>Preeclampsia present or not</strong>, we can see the difference in Survival (undelivered status) and Cumulative deliveries; p-value &lt;0.0001. 50% undelivered probability is at ~12-hr mark if no Preeclampsia, but doubles to 25 hours when Preeclampsia is present. At the same time , cumulative delivered is 57% with Preeclampsia absent but only 24% if Preeclampsia is present.</p>

<p>Since we are always curious about zipcode effects, we use them for the next example below. First, a p-value of 0.12 means no significant difference among the 4 top zipcodes in terms of the probability of being undelivered or the cumulative deliveries at any point in time:</p>

<p>We see that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the probability at any time during OB admission of <strong>not_delivered_yet</strong> is <strong>higher</strong> with PreTerm, Placenta Previa, Preeclampsia, Preeclampsia with infection and Prolonged Labor greater than 20 hours.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, High Risk OB, No Membrane Rupture, Precipitous Labor less than 3 hours, and Age_Group 25-44 years <strong>decrease</strong> such probability.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will continue next with Cox Proportional Hazards Survival Analysis and address Hazard Ratio: the comparative Risk of the Event: (the Risk of) Delivery between two conditions that impact the Event. A reminder:</p>
<p><strong>Hazard</strong>: <em>Risk of Event (risk of Delivery) at any point in time</em> at any given Time</p>
<p><strong>Hazard Ratio (HR)</strong>: <em>Relative hazard rates between two sub-groups (usually of the binarized or “referencialized” group) at any given point in time</em> at any given Time</p>
<p>First, we’ll obtain the HR’s of all variables of interest, then we will select the statistically significant ones which are determined by p-values &lt; 0.05 (and marked by asterisks next to the p-value)</p>

<p>We’ve explored cumulative hazard (where hazard = Delivery) which is accumulated delivery count over time at any time. Now, we will look at Risk Ratio, otherwise known as Hazard Ratio (HR) (risk in this case = Delivery): a comparative Risk analysis, here, between either binarized variables or between subgroups within a group with one subgroup as a reference.</p>

<p>HR calculations showing conditions or variables with a statistically significant self-referential or binarized relative risk or likelihood of Delivery at any point in time</p>
<p>In summary,</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher Risk of Delivery (HR &gt; 1)
<ul>
<li>Increasing Gestational Age (not by much): Each additional day of gestational age slightly increases the risk of delivery at any point in time.</li>
<li>Higher APGAR 1 Score: Higher APGAR scores at 1 minute are associated with an increased risk of delivery at any point in time.</li>
<li>Maternal Age Group 25-44 Years: This age group shows a higher risk of delivery compared to the reference group.</li>
<li>Absence of Membrane Rupture: When there is no membrane rupture, the risk of delivery is higher.</li>
<li>Spontaneous Labor: Spontaneous labor is associated with a higher risk of delivery.</li>
<li>Precipitous Labor Less than 3 Hours: Quick labor (less than 3 hours) increases the risk of delivery.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lower Risk of Delivery (HR &lt; 1)
<ul>
<li>Placenta Previa: This condition significantly lowers the risk of delivery at any point in time.</li>
<li>Prolonged Rupture of Membrane (ROM): Prolonged ROM is associated with a lower risk of delivery.</li>
<li>Preeclampsia (with or without infection): Preeclampsia, whether alone or with infection, decreases the risk of delivery.</li>
<li>Prolonged Labor Greater than 20 Hours: Labor lasting more than 20 hours is associated with a reduced risk of delivery.</li>
<li>Labor Induction: Induced labor is associated with a lower risk of delivery.</li>
<li>APGAR 5: Higher APGAR scores at 5 minutes are associated with a reduced risk of delivery.</li>
<li>Increasing Maternal Age (not by much): Each additional year of maternal age slightly decreases the risk of delivery.</li>
<li>Zip Codes 95076 and 93927: These specific zip codes show a lower risk of delivery at any point in time.</li>

<p><strong>ODDS Ratio (OR)</strong>: <em>measure of association between an exposure and an outcome</em></p>
<p>OR represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure, compared to the odds of the outcome occurring without that exposure. (In logistic regression, it is used to quantify the strength of the association between predictor variables and a binary outcome.) For our data, we will pick, as examples, two outcomes (binarized): presence or absence of intrapartal <strong>events</strong>; and presence or absence of intrapartal <strong>conditions</strong>.</p>
<p>Odds Ratio can answer the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the likelihood of an event occurring in the presence of a certain condition compared to its absence?</p></li>
<li><p>How does exposure to a particular factor influence the probability of an outcome compared to non-exposure?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we identify the strength of association between a predictor and an outcome in a binary response scenario?</p></li>

<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="significant-coefficients"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Significant Coefficients</h2>
<p>In our analysis, we utilized multinomial regression to uncover significant coefficients that explain the relationships between our predictors and the binary outcomes. Unlike the odds ratios, which provide a measure of the strength and direction of the association, the coefficients give a direct indication of the effect size for each predictor.</p>
<p>The plot below displays the significant coefficients (p &lt; 0.05) for our usual outcomes of intrapartal events and intrapartal conditions. Each bar represents the coefficient value for a predictor, indicating the magnitude and direction of its effect on the outcome. Positive coefficients suggest an increase in the likelihood of the outcome with higher predictor values, while negative coefficients indicate a decrease.</p>
<p>This visualization provides a straightforward interpretation of how each significant predictor influences the outcome. The following sections will further detail the specific predictors and their coefficient values for each outcome.</p>

<p>Summary of results as above: The multinomial logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between various predictors and the occurrence of either Intrapartal Events or Intrapartal conditions. The outcome variable was re-coded to model the presence of intrapartal events as “Yes” versus “None”; same for intrapartal conditions. Our interest is in the coefficients.</p>
<p>General Interpretation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Positive Coefficients: Predictors with positive coefficients increase the likelihood of intrapartal events or conditions</p></li>
<li><p>Negative Coefficients: Predictors with negative coefficients decrease the likelihood of intrapartal events or conditions</p></li>
<li><p>Magnitude: The larger the absolute value of the coefficient, the stronger the association with intrapartal events or conditions</p></li>
<li><p>Significance: Predictors with significant p-values (e.g., p &lt; 0.05) are considered to have a statistically significant association with the outcome.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will next engage one more analysis schema, looking for Variable Importance, because we may use our data to make forecasts.</p>
</section>
<section id="variable-importance" class="level2" data-number="4.2">
<h2 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="variable-importance"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Variable Importance</h2>
<p>Variable Importance can answer the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Which predictors are most influential in determining the outcome?</p></li>
<li><p>How do the different features rank in terms of their contribution to the predictive power of the model?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we identify the key drivers of the model’s performance, helping to focus on the most critical variables for decision-making?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Variable Importance</strong>: <em>indicates how useful each variable is for making accurate predictions.</em></p>
<p>The Mean Decrease in Gini Index (MeanDecreaseGini) is one common metric used to measure variable importance. Variables with higher MeanDecreaseGini values are more important for the model: the higher the MeanDecreaseGini, the more influential the variable is in predicting the outcome.</p>
<p>Significance of Variable Importance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Key Predictors: Variables with the highest MeanDecreaseGini values are key predictors for the outcome. They contribute the most to the model’s accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Interpretability: Knowing which variables are most important helps in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will select the top 20 variables for each outcome of Intrapartal Events and Intrapartal Conditions.</p>

OB deliveries are currently performed only at NMC which keeps a standard meticulous record of the delivery event and related issues. Each phase of OB care --prenatal, peripartal and postpartal-- presents opportunities and challenges depending on the effects of relevant factors which impact care, especially the central event of OB care, Delivery.</span>

However, we need to proceed with analytics so we can query the data in order to get desired information. We need to know how variables of interest affect one another, and how they compare with one another in their contribution to the results or outcome of interest to us. The outcome of interest to us in OB can be found in prenatal care (before delivery), during delivery; the event of delivery itself and right after delivery.</span>

<span id="cb4-1050"><a href="#cb4-1050" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>A pre-delivery outcome, for example, is pre-term (prematurity) status; another is High Risk OB status. During delivery, we are concerned about outcomes categorized by "intrapartal conditions" such as preeclampsia and also "intrapartal events" which encompass abnormal labor dynamics. We want to know: Did delivery occur at all? How long was the time from admission to delivery? What are the chances that at a given time delivery will have occurred, and what percent of patients will have delivered by a certain time? For each of these outcomes or combinations thereof, our interest is how and if variables like maternal age, zip code, parity, high risk status, affected the end-result.</span>

<span id="cb4-1052"><a href="#cb4-1052" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>We all are curious to know if and how residential geography affects OB outcomes. We will use zipcode information (the variable, "zip") and a standard MAP to explore this curiosity. High Risk OB is a technical definition; we can explore what contributes to it, as well as determine how it affects other outcomes as mentioned above. A fundamental method in statistical data analytics is to "throw in" all the data, together, "stir it up" and see if the data will settle out in a natural separation into groups--called clustering--that achieves statistical significance. If we can find significant clusters, we can also use them, along with zip and high risk status as probes with which to analyze outcomes.</span>

Further analysis shows that the LLQ cluster is statistically significantly different from either of the 2 other clusters, while this is not the case between these 2 clusters themselves. By adding the 3000 GRAM birth weight dashed horizontal line and the 37 week dashed vertical line, representing the demarcations for SGA and Preterm respectively we find a correspondence between SGA and preterm delivery, a widely known outcome. The clusters were named after this finding, as: Pre-term; Term, early; and Term, full (latter two are from 37 weeks and over). CAVEAT: Actual preterm deliveries as defined by gestational age (alone) under 37 weeks account for only **`r prcnt_preterm`%** of the deliveries, compared to the cluster group here defined by both SGA AND Preterm (**`r clst_smm[3,5]`%**); both are relatively small numbers compared to the total number of deliveries.</span>

The second and third panels tease out the series to extract seasonality information and trend, respectively. The last panel superimposes the seasonality and trend graphs on the original time series. We can see a trend that "trough-ed" around end of the first quarter of 2023 and is rising since then. The seasonality graph nearly matches the original data, indicating that there is a significant seasonal variation in weekly deliveries among our patients.</span>

<span id="cb4-2145"><a href="#cb4-2145" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>:   Survival analysis, or time-to-event analysis, is a statistical method used to analyze the expected duration until one or more events occur, such as death or failure. It involves the use of survival functions to estimate the probability of surviving past a certain time point. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function from observed survival times. Cumulative hazard (cumHaz) functions represent the accumulated risk of the event over time. Hazard ratios (HR) compare the hazard or event rates between two groups, indicating the relative likelihood of the event occurring in one group compared to another.</span>
